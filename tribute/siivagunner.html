					<p><br><br>"It is quite a shame that SilvaGunner is sleeping at this moment, on such a significant date. I must say that I appreciate the work he has put into his rips even up to now. It is indeed a tough job to maintain a channel for nine months. After all, I have been doing it for quite some time now, and thus, I do believe he is having a well-deserved rest.</p>
