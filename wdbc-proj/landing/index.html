        <p>Let's get wild today. We can always carry this a step further. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here.</p>

        <p>Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Fluff that up. Let all these things just sort of happen.</p>

                <p>You're meant to have fun in life. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. We need dark in order to show light. It is a lot of fun.</p>

                <p>I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals.</p>

                <p>Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. It's important to me that you're happy. We'll have a super time. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here.</p>

                <p>Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. Use what you see, don't plan it. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen.</p>

        <p class="quote">I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. This is the way you take out your frustrations. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes.</p>
        <p class="author">- Bob Van Dyke</p>
        <p class="quote"> We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain.</p>
        <p class="author">- Ross Alizarin</p>
        <p class="quote">I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera.</p>

        <p>You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. All you have to do is just let them happen. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet.</p>
